This is a buildbarn[https://github.com/buildbarn] compatible remote worker
implemented in python. It works on the Windows platform and macOS platform.

This worker only be used inside the EVE Echoes team. We may not actively maintain
this repo. We open source it mainly as a reference for those who want to
implement their own custom buildbarn worker.
